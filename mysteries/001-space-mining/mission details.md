# Press Release

On 1st of may, 2064, the LSS General Leyland Bordeux will lave for the Troyans. Earlier scans and the Eisinga probe conform ample deposists of
valuable neutronium on this group of asteroids.

The earths supply of Neutronium, which long supplied our energy needs, are dwindling rapidly. There is nowhere left to look but up. If this mission proves a success the Troyans may provide enough neutronium for many generations to come.

The LSS GLB will be crewed by a team of experienced astronauts. The crew will be led by captain *Henriette Schr√∂der*, an highly experienced pilot who has been involved in the space flight industry for more than 40 years. The navigator and copilot *Bogdan Galjus* graduated top of his class at the astronaut training. Joining the crew also is *Agata Verhoef*, engineer and scientist responsible for much of the technology we use for mining neutronium on earth today.

The team at the Centeral European Asteroid Mining Corporation (C.E.A.M.C.) have built a monster of a space ship. The LLS General Leyland Bordeux (LLS GLB) is equipped with the first large scale Lepton Interfeirence Scanner (L.I.C.). This state of the art device is capable of precisely detecing surface neutronium from hunderdthousands of kilometers away. This allows us to be absolutely sure the ship can land on an asteroid with plenty of neutronium and removes basically all risk from the mission.
