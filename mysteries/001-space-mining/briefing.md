Dear inspector,

As you have probably seen on the news, it seems the LSS General Leyland Bordeux has found almost no neutronium on it's recent
voyage to the Troyans before starting the return. This is suprising to us as scans show ample deposits on most of these asteroids.

The neutronium this mission would bring back would have been essential to replenish Earths energy reserves so this failure not only
cost the investors an enormous amount of money but also dashes one of humanities last hopes.

On behalf of the Centeral European Asteroid Mining Corporation (C.E.A.M.C.), I would like to request your help in finding out how
this mission could go so wrong.

Oliver Wheatly, CEO C.E.A.M.C.
